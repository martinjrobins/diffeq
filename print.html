<p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are a powerful tool for modelling a wide range of physical systems. Unlike purely data-driven models, ODEs are based on the underlying physics, biology, or chemistry of the system being modelled. This makes them particularly useful for predicting the behaviour of a system under conditions that have not been observed before. In this section, we will introduce the basics of ODE modelling, and illustrate their use with a series of examples written using the DiffSol crate.</p>
<p>The topics covered in this section are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/first_order_odes.html">First Order ODEs</a>: First order ODEs are the simplest type of ODE. Any ODE system can be written as a set of first order ODEs, so libraries like DiffSol are designed such that the user provides their equations in this form.
<ul>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/population_dynamics.html">Example: Population Dynamics</a>: A simple example of a first order ODE system, modelling the interaction of predator and prey populations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/higher_order_odes.html">Higher Order ODEs</a>: Higher order ODEs are ODEs that involve derivatives of order higher than one. These can be converted to a system of first order ODEs, which is the form that DiffSol expects.
<ul>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/spring_mass_systems.html">Example: Spring-mass systems</a>: A simple example of a higher order ODE system, modelling the motion of a damped spring-mass system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/discrete_events.html">Discrete Events</a>: Discrete events are events that occur at specific times or when the system is in a particular state, rather than continuously. These can be modelled using ODEs by treating the events as changes in the system's state. DiffSol provides an API to detect and handle these events.
<ul>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/compartmental_models_of_drug_delivery.html">Example: Compartmental models of Drug Delivery</a>: Pharmacokinetic models are a common example of systems with discrete events, where the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolised, and excreted by the body. The drug is often administered at discrete times, and the model must account for this.</li>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/bouncing_ball.html">Example: Bouncing Ball</a>: A simple example of a system where the discrete event occurs when the ball hits the ground, instead of a specific time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="primer/./primer/the_mass_matrix.html">DAEs via the Mass Matrix</a>: Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs) are a generalisation of ODEs that include algebraic equations as well as differential equations. DiffSol can solve DAEs by treating them as ODEs with a mass matrix. This section explains how to use the mass matrix to solve DAEs.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="explicit-first-order-odes"><a class="header" href="#explicit-first-order-odes">Explicit First Order ODEs</a></h1>
<p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are sometimes called rate equations because they describe how the <em>rate of change</em> of a system depends on its current <em>state</em>. For example, lets assume we wish to model the growth of a population of cells within a petri dish. We could define the <em>state</em> of the system as the concentration of cells in the dish, and assign this state to a variable \(c\). The <em>rate of change</em> of the system would then be the rate at which the concentration of cells changes with time, which we could denote as \(\frac{dc}{dt}\). We know that our cells will grow at a rate proportional to the current concentration of cells, so we could write this as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dc}{dt} = k c
\]</p>
<p>where \(k\) is a constant that describes the growth rate of the cells. This is a first order ODE, because it involves only the first derivative of the state variable \(c\) with respect to time. We can write down a general form for a first order ODE as:</p>
<p>We can also use the same form to solve a coupled set of equations, say we had <em>two</em> populations of cells in the same dish that grow with different rates. We could define the state of the system as the concentrations of the two cell populations, and assign these states to variables \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). We could then write down both equations as:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{dc_1}{dt} &amp;= k_1 c_1  \\
\frac{dc_2}{dt} &amp;= k_2 c_2
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>then combine them in a vector form as:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{dc_1}{dt} \\
\frac{dc_2}{dt}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
k_1 c_1 \\
k_2 c_2
\end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>By defining a new <em>vector</em> of state variables \(\mathbf{y} = [c_1, c_2]\) and a a function \(\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} k_1 c_1 \\ k_2 c_2 \end{bmatrix}\), we are left with the standard form of a <em>explicit</em> first order ODE system:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>This is an explicit equation for the derivative of the state, \(\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt}\), as a function of only of the state variables \(\mathbf{y}\) and of time \(t\).</p>
<p>We need one more piece of information to solve this system of ODEs: the initial conditions for the populations at time \(t = 0\). For example, if we started with a concentration of 10 for the first population and 5 for the second population, we would write:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 10 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>Many ODE solver libraries, like DiffSol, require users to provide their ODEs in the form of a set of explicit first order ODEs. Given both the system of ODEs and the initial conditions, the solver can then integrate the equations forward in time to find the solution \(\mathbf{y}(t)\). This is the general process for solving ODEs, so it is important to know how to translate your problem into a set of first order ODEs, and thus to the general form of a explicit first order ODE system shown above. In the next two sections, we will look at two examples of first order ODE systems: population dynamics and infectious disease, and solve them using DiffSol.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="population-dynamics---predator-prey-model"><a class="header" href="#population-dynamics---predator-prey-model">Population Dynamics - Predator-Prey Model</a></h1>
<p>In this example, we will model the population dynamics of a predator-prey system using a set of first order ODEs. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations">Lotka-Volterra equations</a> are a classic example of a predator-prey model, and describe the interactions between two species in an ecosystem. The first species is a prey species, which we will call \(x\), and the second species is a predator species, which we will call \(y\).</p>
<p>The rate of change of the prey population is governed by two terms: growth and predation. The growth term represents the natural increase in the prey population in the absence of predators, and is proportional to the current population of prey. The predation term represents the rate at which the predators consume the prey, and is proportional to the product of the prey and predator populations. The rate of change of the prey population can be written as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = a x - b x y
\]</p>
<p>where \(a\) is the growth rate of the prey population, and \(b\) is the predation rate.</p>
<p>The rate of change of the predator population is also governed by two terms: death and growth. The death term represents the natural decrease in the predator population in the absence of prey, and is proportional to the current population of predators. The growth term represents the rate at which the predators reproduce, and is proportional to the product of the prey and predator populations, since the predators need to consume the prey to reproduce. The rate of change of the predator population can be written as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = c x y - d y
\]</p>
<p>where \(c\) is the reproduction rate of the predators, and \(d\) is the death rate.</p>
<p>The Lotka-Volterra equations are a simple model of predator-prey dynamics, and make several assumptions that may not hold in real ecosystems. For example, the model assumes that the prey population grows exponentially in the absence of predators, that the predator population decreases linearly in the absence of prey, and that the spatial distribution of the species has no effect. Despite these simplifications, the Lotka-Volterra equations capture some of the essential features of predator-prey interactions, such as oscillations in the populations and the dependence of each species on the other. When modelling with ODEs, it is important to consider the simplest model that captures the behaviour of interest, and to be aware of the assumptions that underlie the model.</p>
<p>Putting the two equations together, we have a system of two first order ODEs:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{x}{dt} = a x - b x y \\
\frac{y}{dt} = c x y - d y
\]</p>
<p>which can be written in vector form as:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{dx}{dt} \\
\frac{dy}{dt}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
a x - b x y \\
c x y - d y
\end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>or in the general form of a first order ODE system:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>\[\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} a x - b x y \\ c x y - d y \end{bmatrix}\]</p>
<p>We also have initial conditions for the populations at time \(t = 0\). We can set both populations to 1 at the start like so:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>Let's solve this system of ODEs using the DiffSol crate. We will use the <a href="https://martinjrobins.github.io/diffsl/">DiffSL</a> domain-specific language to specify the problem. We could have also used <a href="primer/specify/ode_equations.html">Rust closures</a>, but this allows us to illustrate the modelling process with a minimum of Rust syntax.</p>

<p>A phase plane plot of the predator-prey system is a useful visualisation of the dynamics of the system. This plot shows the prey population on the x-axis and the predator population on the y-axis. Trajectories in the phase plane represent the evolution of the populations over time. Lets reframe the equations to introduce a new parameter \(y_0\) which is the initial predator and prey population. We can then plot the phase plane for different values of \(y_0\) to see how the system behaves for different initial conditions.</p>
<p>Our initial conditions are now:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>so we can solve this system for different values of \(y_0\) and plot the phase plane for each case. We will use similar code as above, but we will introduce our new parameter and loop over different values of \(y_0\)</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="higher-order-odes"><a class="header" href="#higher-order-odes">Higher Order ODEs</a></h1>
<p>The <em>order</em> of an ODE is the highest derivative that appears in the equation. So far, we have only looked at first order ODEs, which involve only the first derivative of the state variable with respect to time. However, many physical systems are described by higher order ODEs, which involve second or higher derivatives of the state variable. A simple example of a second order ODE is the motion of a mass under the influence of gravity. The equation of motion for the mass can be written as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -g
\]</p>
<p>where \(x\) is the position of the mass, \(t\) is time, and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. This is a second order ODE because it involves the second derivative of the position with respect to time.</p>
<p>Higher order ODEs can always be rewritten as a system of first order ODEs by introducing new variables. For example, we can rewrite the second order ODE above as a system of two first order ODEs by introducing a new variable for the velocity of the mass:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= v \\
\frac{dv}{dt} &amp;= -g
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>where \(v = \frac{dx}{dt}\) is the velocity of the mass. This is a system of two first order ODEs, which can be written in vector form as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ v \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ -g \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll look at another example of a higher order ODE system: the spring-mass system, and solve this using DiffSol.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="example-spring-mass-systems"><a class="header" href="#example-spring-mass-systems">Example: Spring-mass systems</a></h1>
<p>We will model a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-spring-damper_model">damped spring-mass system</a> using a second order ODE. The system consists of a mass \(m\) attached to a spring with spring constant \(k\), and a damping force proportional to the velocity of the mass with damping coefficient \(c\).</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Mass_spring_damper.svg/330px-Mass_spring_damper.svg.png" alt="Spring-mass system" /></p>
<p>The equation of motion for the mass can be written as:</p>
<p>\[
m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -k x - c \frac{dx}{dt}
\]</p>
<p>where \(x\) is the position of the mass, \(t\) is time, and the negative sign on the right hand side indicates that the spring force and damping force act in the opposite direction to the displacement of the mass.</p>
<p>We can convert this to a system of two first order ODEs by introducing a new variable for the velocity of the mass:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= v \\
\frac{dv}{dt} &amp;= -\frac{k}{m} x - \frac{c}{m} v
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>where \(v = \frac{dx}{dt}\) is the velocity of the mass.</p>
<p>We can solve this system of ODEs using DiffSol with the following code:</p>

<p>ODEs describe the continuous evolution of a system over time, but many systems also involve discrete events that occur at specific times. For example, in a compartmental model of drug delivery, the administration of a drug is a discrete event that occurs at a specific time. In a bouncing ball model, the collision of the ball with the ground is a discrete event that changes the state of the system. It is normally difficult to model these events using ODEs alone, as they require a different approach to handle the discontinuities in the system. While we can represent discrete events mathematically using delta functions, many ODE solvers are not designed to handle these discontinuities, and may produce inaccurate results or fail to converge during the integration.</p>
<p>DiffSol provides a way to model discrete events in a system of ODEs by maintaining an internal state of each solver that can be updated when a discrete event occurs. Each solver has an internal state that holds information such as the current time \(t\), the current state of the system \(\mathbf{y}\), and other solver-specific information. When a discrete event occurs, the user can update the internal state of the solver to reflect the change in the system, and then continue the integration of the ODEs as normal.</p>
<p>DiffSol also provides a way to stop the integration of the ODEs, either at a specific time or when a specific condition is met. This can be useful for modelling systems with discrete events, as it allows the user to control the integration of the ODEs and to handle the events in a flexible way.</p>
<p>The <a href="primer/../solving_the_problem.html">Solving the Problem</a> and <a href="primer/../specify/root_finding.html">Root Finding</a> sections provides an introduction to the API for solving ODEs and detecting events with DiffSol. In the next two sections, we will look at two examples of systems with discrete events: compartmental models of drug delivery and bouncing ball models, and solve them using DiffSol using this API.</p>

<p>The field of Pharmacokinetics (PK) provides a quantitative basis for describing the delivery of a drug to a patient, the diffusion of that drug through the plasma/body tissue, and the subsequent clearance of the drug from the patient's system. PK is used to ensure that there is sufficient concentration of the drug to maintain the required efficacy of the drug, while ensuring that the concentration levels remain below the toxic threshold. Pharmacokinetic (PK) models are often combined with Pharmacodynamic (PD) models, which model the positive effects of the drug, such as the  binding of a drug to the biological target, and/or undesirable side effects, to form a full PKPD model of the drug-body interaction. This example will only focus on PK, neglecting the interaction with a PD model.</p>

<p>PK enables the following processes to be quantified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absorption</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>Metabolism</li>
<li>Excretion</li>
</ul>
<p>These are often referred to as ADME, and taken together describe the drug concentration in the body when medicine is prescribed. These ADME processes are typically described by zeroth-order or first-order <em>rate</em> reactions modelling the dynamics of the quantity of drug $q$, with a given rate parameter $k$, for example:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = -k^*,
\]</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = -k q.
\]</p>
<p>The body itself is modelled as one or more <em>compartments</em>, each of which is defined as a kinetically homogeneous unit (these compartments do not relate to specific organs in the body, unlike Physiologically based pharmacokinetic, PBPK, modeling). There is typically a main <em>central</em> compartment into which the drug is administered and from which the drug is excreted from the body, combined with zero or more <em>peripheral</em> compartments to which the drug can be distributed to/from the central compartment (See Fig 2). Each
peripheral compartment is only connected to the central compartment.</p>
<p><img src="https://sabs-r3.github.io/software-engineering-projects/fig/pk2.svg" alt="Fig 2" /></p>
<p>The following example PK model describes the two-compartment model shown diagrammatically in the figure above. The time-dependent variables to be solved are the drug quantity in the central and peripheral compartments, $q_c$ and $q_{p1}$ (units: [ng]) respectively.</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dq_c}{dt} = \text{Dose}(t) - \frac{q_c}{V_c} CL - Q_{p1} \left ( \frac{q_c}{V_c} - \frac{q_{p1}}{V_{p1}} \right ),
\]</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dq_{p1}}{dt} =  Q_{p1} \left ( \frac{q_c}{V_c} - \frac{q_{p1}}{V_{p1}} \right ).
\]</p>
<p>This model describes an <em>intravenous bolus</em> dosing protocol, with a linear clearance from the central compartment (non-linear clearance processes are also possible, but not considered here). The dose function $\text{Dose}(t)$ will consist of instantaneous doses of $X$ ng of the drug at one or more time points. The other input parameters to the model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(V_c\) [mL], the volume of the central compartment</li>
<li>\(V_{p1}\) [mL], the volume of the first peripheral compartment</li>
<li>\(CL\) [mL/h], the clearance/elimination rate from the central compartment</li>
<li>\(Q_{p1}\) [mL/h], the transition rate between central compartment and peripheral compartment 1</li>
</ul>
<p>We will solve this system of ODEs using the DiffSol crate. Rather than trying to write down the dose function as a mathematical function, we will neglect the dose function from the equations and instead using DiffSol's API to specify the dose at specific time points.</p>
<p>First lets write down the equations in the standard form of a first order ODE system:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} q_c \\ q_{p1} \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} - \frac{q_c}{V_c} CL - Q_{p1} \left ( \frac{q_c}{V_c} - \frac{q_{p1}}{V_{p1}} \right ) \\ Q_{p1} \left ( \frac{q_c}{V_c} - \frac{q_{p1}}{V_{p1}} \right ) \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>We will also need to specify the initial conditions for the system:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>For the dose function, we will specify a dose of 1000 ng at regular intervals of 6 hours. We will also specify the other parameters of the model:</p>
<p>\[
V_c = 1000 \text{ mL}, \quad V_{p1} = 1000 \text{ mL}, \quad CL = 100 \text{ mL/h}, \quad Q_{p1} = 50 \text{ mL/h}
\]</p>
<p>Let's now solve this system of ODEs using DiffSol.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="example-bouncing-ball"><a class="header" href="#example-bouncing-ball">Example: Bouncing Ball</a></h1>
<p>Modelling a bouncing ball is a simple and intuitive example of a system with discrete events. The ball is dropped from a height \(h\) and bounces off the ground with a coefficient of restitution \(e\). When the ball hits the ground, its velocity is reversed and scaled by the coefficient of restitution, and the ball rises and then continues to fall until it hits the ground again. This process repeats until halted.</p>
<p>The second order ODE that describes the motion of the ball is given by:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -g
\]</p>
<p>where \(x\) is the position of the ball, \(t\) is time, and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. We can rewrite this as a system of two first order ODEs by introducing a new variable for the velocity of the ball:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= v \\
\frac{dv}{dt} &amp;= -g
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>where \(v = \frac{dx}{dt}\) is the velocity of the ball. This is a system of two first order ODEs, which can be written in vector form as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ v \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ -g \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>The initial conditions for the ball, including the height from which it is dropped and its initial velocity, are given by:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} h \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>When the ball hits the ground, we need to update the velocity of the ball according to the coefficient of restitution, which is the ratio of the velocity after the bounce to the velocity before the bounce. The velocity after the bounce \(v'\) is given by:</p>
<p>\[
v' = -e v
\]</p>
<p>where \(e\) is the coefficient of restitution. However, to implement this in our ODE solver, we need to detect when the ball hits the ground. We can do this by using DiffSol's event handling feature, which allows us to specify a function that is equal to zero when the event occurs, i.e. when the ball hits the ground. This function \(g(\mathbf{y}, t)\) is called an event or root function, and for our bouncing ball problem, it is given by:</p>
<p>\[
g(\mathbf{y}, t) = x
\]</p>
<p>where \(x\) is the position of the ball. When the ball hits the ground, the event function will be zero and DiffSol will stop the integration, and we can update the velocity of the ball accordingly.</p>
<p>In code, the bouncing ball problem can be solved using DiffSol as follows:</p>

<p>Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are a generalisation of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that include algebraic equations, or equations that do not involve derivatives. Algebraic equations can arise in many physical systems and often are used to model constraints on the system, such as conservation laws or other relationships between the state variables. For example, in an electrical circuit, the current flowing into a node must equal the current flowing out of the node, which can be written as an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>DAEs can be written in the general implicit form:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}', t) = 0
\]</p>
<p>where \(\mathbf{y}\) is the vector of state variables, \(\mathbf{y}'\) is the vector of derivatives of the state variables, and \(\mathbf{F}\) is a vector-valued function that describes the system of equations. However, for the purposes of this primer and the capabilities of DiffSol, we will focus on a specific form of DAEs called index-1 or semi-explicit DAEs, which can be written as a combination of differential and algebraic equations:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} &amp;= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}', t) \\
0 = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>where \(\mathbf{f}\) is the vector-valued function that describes the differential equations and \(\mathbf{g}\) is the vector-valued function that describes the algebraic equations. The key difference between DAEs and ODEs is that DAEs include algebraic equations that must be satisfied at each time step, in addition to the differential equations that describe the rate of change of the state variables.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the standard form of an explicit ODE that we have seen before? Recall that an explicit ODE can be written as:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>Lets update this equation to include a matrix \(\mathbf{M}\) that multiplies the derivative term:</p>
<p>\[
M \frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>When \(M\) is the identity matrix (i.e. a matrix with ones along the diagonal), this reduces to the standard form of an explicit ODE. However, when \(M\) has diagonal entries that are zero, this introduces algebraic equations into the system and it reduces to the semi-explicit DAE equations show above. The matrix \(M\) is called the <em>mass matrix</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, we now have a general form of a set of differential equations, that includes both ODEs and semi-explicit DAEs. This general form is used by DiffSol to allow users to specify a wide range of problems, from simple ODEs to more complex DAEs. In the next section, we will look at a few examples of DAEs and how to solve them using DiffSol and a mass matrix.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="example-electrical-circuits"><a class="header" href="#example-electrical-circuits">Example: Electrical Circuits</a></h1>
<p>Lets consider the following low-pass LRC filter circuit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">    +---L---+---C---+
    |       |       |
V_s =       R       |
    |       |       |
    +-------+-------+
</code></pre>
<p>The circuit consists of a resistor \(R\), an inductor \(L\), and a capacitor \(C\) connected in series to a voltage source \(V_s\). The voltage across the resistor \(V\) is given by Ohm's law:</p>
<p>\[
V = R i_R
\]</p>
<p>where \(i_R\) is the current flowing through the resistor. The voltage across the inductor is given by:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = \frac{V_s - V}{L}
\]</p>
<p>where \(di_L/dt\) is the rate of change of current with respect to time. The voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the resistor and the equation for an ideal capacitor is:</p>
<p>\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{i_C}{C}
\]</p>
<p>where \(i_C\) is the current flowing through the capacitor. The sum of the currents flowing into and out of the top-center node of the circuit must be zero according to Kirchhoff's current law:</p>
<p>\[
i_L = i_R + i_C
\]</p>
<p>Thus we have a system of two differential equations and two algebraic equation that describe the evolution of the currents through the resistor, inductor, and capacitor, and the voltage across the resistor. We can write these equations in the general form:</p>
<p>\[
M \frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t)
\]</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} i_R \\ i_L \\ i_C \\ V \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} V - R i_R \\ \frac{V_s - V}{L} \\ i_L - i_R - i_C \\ \frac{i_C}{C} \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>The mass matrix \(M\) has one on the diagonal for the differential equations and zero for the algebraic equation.</p>
<p>\[
M = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>Instead of providing the mass matrix explicitly, the DiffSL language specifies the multiplication of the mass matrix with the derivative term, \(M \frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt}\), which is given by:</p>
<p>\[
M \frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{di_L}{dt} \\ 0 \\ \frac{dV}{dt} \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>The initial conditions for the system are:</p>
<p>\[
\mathbf{y}(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]</p>
<p>The voltage source \(V_s\) acts as a forcing function for the system, and we can specify this as sinusoidal function of time.</p>
<p>\[
V_s(t) = V_0 \sin(omega t)
\]</p>
<p>where \(omega\) is the angular frequency of the source. Since this is a low-pass filter, we will choose a high frequency for the source, say \(omega = 200\), to demonstrate the filtering effect of the circuit.</p>
<p>We can solve this system of equations using DiffSol and plot the current and voltage across the resistor as a function of time.</p>

<p>Most of the DiffSol user-facing API revolves around specifying the problem you want to solve, thus a large part of this book will be dedicated to explaining how to specify a problem. All the examples presented in <a href="specify/../primer/modelling_with_odes.html">the primer</a> used the DiffSL DSL to specify the problem, but DiffSol also provides a pure Rust API for specifying problems. This API is sometimes more verbose than the DSL, but is more flexible, more performant, and easier to use if you have a model already written in Rust or another language that you can easily port or call from Rust.</p>
<h2 id="ode-equations"><a class="header" href="#ode-equations">ODE equations</a></h2>
<p>The class of ODE equations that DiffSol can solve are of the form</p>
<p>\[M(t) \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y, p),\]
\[y(t_0) = y_0(t_0, p),\]
\[z(t) = g(t, y, p),\]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(f(t, y, p)\) is the right-hand side of the ODE,</li>
<li>\(y\) is the state vector,</li>
<li>\(p\) are the parameters,</li>
<li>\(t\) is the time.</li>
<li>\(y_0(t_0, p)\) is the initial state vector at time \(t_0\).</li>
<li>\(M(t)\) is the mass matrix (this is optional, and is implicitly the identity matrix if not specified),</li>
<li>\(g(t, y, p)\) is an output function that can be used to calculate additional outputs from the state vector (this is optional, and is implicitly \(g(t, y, p) = y\) if not specified).</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can also optionally specify a root function \(r(t, y, p)\) that can be used to find the time at which a root occurs.</p>
<h2 id="diffsol-problem-apis"><a class="header" href="#diffsol-problem-apis">DiffSol problem APIs</a></h2>
<p>DiffSol has three main APIs for specifying problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/builder/struct.OdeBuilder.html"><code>OdeBuilder</code></a> struct, where the user can specify the functions above using Rust closures.
This is the easiest API to use from Rust, and is the recommended API for most users.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/equations/trait.OdeEquations.html"><code>OdeEquations</code></a> trait
where the user can implement the functions above on their own structs.
This API is more flexible than the <code>OdeBuilder</code> API, but is more complex to use. It is useful if you have custom data structures and code that you want to use to evaluate
your functions that does not fit within the <code>OdeBuilder</code> API.</li>

<p>The simplest way to create a new ode problem in Rust is to use the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/builder/struct.OdeBuilder.html"><code>OdeBuilder</code></a> struct.
You can set the initial time, initial step size, relative tolerance, absolute tolerance, and parameters, or leave them at their default values.
Then, call one of the <code>build_*</code> functions to create a new problem, for example the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/builder/struct.OdeBuilder.html#method.build_ode"><code>build_ode</code></a>
function can be used to create an ODE problem of the form \(dy/dt = f(t, y, p)\), where \(y\) is the state vector, \(t\) is the time, and \(p\) are the parameters.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how to create a new ODE problem using the <code>OdeBuilder</code> struct.
The specific problem we will solve is the logistic equation</p>
<p>\[\frac{dy}{dt} = r y (1 - y/K),\]</p>
<p>where \(r\) is the growth rate and \(K\) is the carrying capacity.
To specify the problem, we need to provide the \(dy/dt\) function \(f(y, p, t)\),
and the jacobian of \(f\) multiplied by a vector \(v\) function, which we will call \(f'(y, p, t, v)\). That is</p>
<p>\[f(y, p, t) = r y (1 - y/K),\]
\[f'(y, p, t, v) = rv (1 - 2y/K),\]</p>
<p>and the initial state</p>
<p>\[y_0(p, t) = 0.1\]</p>
<p>This can be done using the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use diffsol::OdeBuilder;
use nalgebra::DVector;
type M = nalgebra::DMatrix&lt;f64&gt;;

let problem = OdeBuilder::new()
    .t0(0.0)
    .rtol(1e-6)
    .atol([1e-6])
    .p(vec![1.0, 10.0])
    .build_ode::&lt;M, _, _, _&gt;(
       |x, p, _t, y| y[0] = p[0] * x[0] * (1.0 - x[0] / p[1]),
       |x, p, _t, v , y| y[0] = p[0] * v[0] * (1.0 - 2.0 * x[0] / p[1]),
       |_p, _t| DVector::from_element(1, 0.1),
    ).unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Each <code>build_*</code> method requires the user to specify what matrix type they wish to use to define and solve the model (the other types are inferred from the closure types).
Here we use the <code>nalgebra::DMatrix&lt;f64&gt;</code> type, which is a dense matrix type from the <a href="https://nalgebra.org">nalgebra</a> crate. Other options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>faer::Mat&lt;T&gt;</code> from <a href="https://github.com/sarah-ek/faer-rs">faer</a>, which is a dense matrix type.</li>
<li><code>diffsol::SparseColMat&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is a thin wrapper around <code>faer::sparse::SparseColMat&lt;T&gt;</code>, a sparse compressed sparse column matrix type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these matrix types have an associated vector type that is used to represent the vectors in the problem (i.e. the state vector \(y\), the parameter vector \(p\), and the gradient vector \(v\)).
You can see in the example above that the <code>DVector</code> type is explicitly used to create the initial state vector in the third closure.
For these matrix types the associated vector type is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nalgebra::DVector&lt;T&gt;</code> for <code>nalgebra::DMatrix&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>faer::Col&lt;T&gt;</code> for <code>faer::Mat&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>faer::Coll&lt;T&gt;</code> for <code>diffsol::SparseColMat&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments to the <code>build_ode</code> method are the equations that define the problem.
The first closure is the function \(f(y, p, t)\) this is implemented as a closure that takes the time <code>t</code>,
the parameter vector <code>p</code>, the state vector <code>y</code>, and a mutable reference that the closure can use to place the result (i.e. the derivative of the state vector \(f(y, p, t)\)).
The second closure is similar in structure in defines the jacobian multiplied by a vector \(v\) function \(f'(y, p, t, v)\).
The third closure returns the initial state vector \(y_0(p, t)\), this is done so that diffsol can infer the size of the state vector.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mass-matrix"><a class="header" href="#mass-matrix">Mass matrix</a></h1>
<p>In some cases, it is necessary to include a mass matrix in the problem, such that the problem is of the form</p>
<p>\[M(t) \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y, p).\]</p>
<p>A mass matrix is useful for PDE discretisation that lead to a non-identity mass matrix, or for DAE problems that can be transformed into ODEs with a singular mass matrix.
Diffsol can handle singular and non-singular mass matrices, and the mass matrix can be time-dependent.</p>
<h2 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate the addition of a mass matrix to a problem, we will once again take the logistic equation, but this time we will add an additional variable that is set via an algebraic equation.
This system is written as</p>
<p>\[\frac{dy}{dt} = r y (1 - y/K),\]
\[0 = y - z,\]</p>
<p>where \(z\) is the additional variable with a solution \(z = y\). When this system is put in the form \(M(t) \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y, p)\), the mass matrix is</p>
<p>\[M(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}.\]</p>
<p>Like the Jacobian, the DiffSol builder does not require the full mass matrix, instead users can provide a function that gives a GEMV (General Matrix-Vector) product of the mass matrix with a vector.</p>
<p>\[m(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{p}, t, \beta, \mathbf{y}) = M(p, t) \mathbf{v} + \beta \mathbf{y}. \]</p>
<p>Thus, to specify this problem using DiffSol, we can use the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/builder/struct.OdeBuilder.html"><code>OdeBuilder</code></a> struct and provide the functions:</p>
<p>\[f(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{p}, t) = \begin{bmatrix} r y_0 (1 - y_0/K) \\ y_0 - y_1 \end{bmatrix},\]
\[f'(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{p}, t, \mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} r v_0 (1 - 2 y_0/K) \\ v_0 - v_1 \end{bmatrix},\]
\[m(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{p}, t, \beta, \mathbf{y}) = \begin{bmatrix} v_0 + \beta y_0 \\ \beta y_1 \end{bmatrix}.\]</p>
<p>where \(f\) is the right-hand side of the ODE, \(f'\) is the Jacobian of \(f\) multiplied by a vector, and \(m\) is the mass matrix multiplied by a vector.</p>

<p>Root finding is the process of finding the values of the variables that make a set of equations equal to zero. This is a common problem where you want to

<p>Using the logistic example, we can add a root finding function \(r(y, p, t)\) that will stop the solver when the value of \(y\) is such that \(r(y, p, t) = 0\).
For this example we'll use the root finding function \(r(y, p, t) = y - 0.5\), which will stop the solver when the value of \(y\) is 0.5.</p>
<p>\[\frac{dy}{dt} = r y (1 - y/K),\]

<p>here we have added the root finding function \(r(y, p, t) = y - 0.5\), and also let DiffSol know that we have one root function by passing <code>1</code> as the last argument to the <code>build_ode_with_root</code> method.

<p>In this section we will discuss how to compute the forward sensitivity of the solution of an ODE problem. The forward sensitivity is the derivative of the solution with respect to the parameters of the problem. This is useful for many applications, such as parameter estimation, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-the-sensitivity-problem"><a class="header" href="#specifying-the-sensitivity-problem">Specifying the sensitivity problem</a></h2>
<p>We will again use the example of the logistic growth equation, but this time we will compute the sensitivity of the solution \(y\) with respect to the parameters \(r\) and \(K\) (i.e. \(\frac{dy}{dr}\) and \(\frac{dy}{dK}\)).
The logistic growth equation is:</p>
<p>\[\frac{dy}{dt} = r y (1 - y/K),\]
\[y(0) = 0.1\]</p>
<p>Recall from <a href="specify/ode_equations.html">ODE equations</a> that we also need to provide the jacobian of the right hand side of the ODE with respect to the state vector \(y\) and the gradient vector \(v\), which we will call \(J\). This is:</p>
<p>\[J v = \begin{bmatrix} r v (1 - 2 y/K) \end{bmatrix}.\]</p>
<p>Using the logistic growth equation above, we can compute the partial derivative of the right hand side of the ODE with respect to the vector \([r, K]\) multiplied by a vector \(v = [v_r, v_K]\), which we will call \(J_p v\). This is:</p>
<p>\[J_p v = v_r y (1 - y/K) + v_K r y^2 / K^2 .\]</p>
<p>We also need the partial derivative of the initial state vector with respect to the parameters multiplied by a vector \(v\), which we will call \(J_{y_0} v\). Since the initial state vector is constant, this is just zero</p>
<p>\[J_{y_0} v = 0.\]</p>
<p>We can then use the <code>OdeBuilder</code> struct to specify the sensitivity problem. The <code>build_ode_with_sens</code> method is used to create a new problem that includes the sensitivity equations.</p>

<p>There we go, all done! This demonstrates how to implement a custom struct to specify a rhs function. But this is a fair bit of boilerplate code, do we really need to do all this for <strong>every</strong> function we want to implement?</p>

<p>Once you have structs implementing the functions for your system of equations, you can use the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/equations/struct.OdeSolverEquations.html"><code>OdeSolverEquations</code></a> struct
to put it all together. This struct implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/equations/trait.OdeEquations.html"><code>OdeEquations</code></a> trait, and can be used to specify the problem to the solver.</p>
<p>Note that it is optional to use the <code>OdeSolverEquations</code> struct, you can implement the <code>OdeEquations</code> trait directly if you prefer, but the <code>OdeSolverEquations</code> struct can be useful to reduce boilerplate code
and make it easier to specify the problem.</p>
<h2 id="getting-all-your-traits-in-order"><a class="header" href="#getting-all-your-traits-in-order">Getting all your traits in order</a></h2>
<p>The <code>OdeSolverEquations</code> struct requires arguments corresponding to the right-hand side function, mass matrix, root function, initial condition, and output functions.
For those that you want to provide, you can implement <code>NonLinearOp</code>, <code>LinearOp</code>, and <code>ConstantOp</code> traits for your structs, as described in the previous sections.
However, some of these arguments are optional and can be set to <code>None</code> if not needed. To do this, you still need to provide a placeholder type for these arguments, so you can use the
included <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/op/unit/struct.UnitCallable.html"><code>UnitCallable</code></a> type for this purpose. For example lets assume that we already have objects implementing
the <code>NonLinearOp</code> trait for the right-hand side function, and the <code>ConstantOp</code> trait for the initial condition, but we don't have a mass matrix, root function, or output function.
We can specify the missing arguments like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">type T = f64;

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="creating-the-equations"><a class="header" href="#creating-the-equations">Creating the equations</a></h2>
<p>Now we have variables <code>rhs</code> and <code>init</code> that are structs implementing the required traits, and <code>mass</code>, <code>root</code>, and <code>out</code> set to <code>None</code>. Using these, we can create the <code>OdeSolverEquations</code> struct,
and then provide it to the <code>OdeBuilder</code> struct to create the problem.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diffsl"><a class="header" href="#diffsl">DiffSL</a></h1>
<p>Thus far we have used Rust code to specify the problem we want to solve. This is fine if you are using DiffSol from Rust, but what if you want to use DiffSol from a higher-level language like Python or R?
For this usecase we have designed a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called DiffSL that can be used to specify the problem. DiffSL is not a general purpose language but is tightly constrained to
the specification of a system of ordinary differential equations. It features a relatively simple syntax that consists of writing a series of tensors (dense or sparse) that represent the equations of the system.
For more detail on the syntax of DiffSL see the <a href="https://martinjrobins.github.io/diffsl/">DiffSL book</a>. This section will focus on how to use DiffSL to specify a problem in DiffSol.</p>
<h2 id="diffsl-context"><a class="header" href="#diffsl-context">DiffSL Context</a></h2>
<p>The main struct that is used to specify a problem in DiffSL is the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/diffsl/struct.DiffSl.html"><code>DiffSl</code></a> struct. Creating this struct
Just-In-Time (JIT) compiles your DiffSL code into a form that can be executed efficiently by DiffSol.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use diffsol::{DiffSl, CraneliftModule};
type M = nalgebra::DMatrix&lt;f64&gt;;
type CG = CraneliftModule;
        
let eqn = DiffSl::&lt;M, CG&gt;::compile("
    in = [r, k]
    r { 1.0 }
    k { 1.0 }
    u { 0.1 }
    F { r * u * (1.0 - u / k) }
").unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>CG</code> parameter specifies the backend that you want to use to compile the DiffSL code. The <code>CraneliftModule</code> backend is the default backend and is behind the <code>diffsl</code> feature flag. If you want to use the faster LLVM backend you can use the <code>LlvmModule</code> backend, which is behind one of the <code>diffsl-llvm*</code> feature flags, depending on the version of LLVM you have installed.</p>
<p>Once you have created the <code>DiffSl</code> struct you can use it to create a problem using the <code>build_from_eqn</code> method on the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/builder/struct.OdeBuilder.html"><code>OdeBuilder</code></a> struct.</p>

<p>Lets consider a large system of equations that have a jacobian matrix that is sparse. For simplicity we will start with the logistic equation from the <a href="specify/./specifying_the_problem.html">"Specifying the Problem"</a> section,
but we will duplicate this equation 10 times to create a system of 10 equations. This system will have a jacobian matrix that is a diagonal matrix with 10 diagonal elements, and all other elements are zero.</p>
<p>Since this system is sparse, we choose a sparse matrix type to represent the jacobian matrix. We will use the <code>diffsol::SparseColMat&lt;T&gt;</code> type, which is a thin wrapper around <code>faer::sparse::SparseColMat&lt;T&gt;</code>, a sparse compressed sparse column matrix type.</p>

<p>Note that we have not specified the jacobian itself, but instead we have specified the jacobian multiplied by a vector function \(f'(y, p, t, v)\).
DiffSol will use this function to generate a jacobian matrix, and since we have specified a sparse matrix type, DiffSol will attempt to
guess the sparsity pattern of the jacobian matrix and use this to efficiently generate the jacobian matrix.</p>

<p>DiffSol attempts to guess the sparsity pattern of your jacobian matrix by calling the \(f'(y, p, t, v)\) function repeatedly with different one-hot vectors \(v\)
with a <code>NaN</code> value at each index. The output of this function (i.e. which elements are <code>0</code> and which are <code>NaN</code>) is then used to determine the sparsity pattern of the jacobian matrix.
Due to the fact that for IEEE 754 floating point numbers, <code>NaN</code> is propagated through most operations, this method is able to detect which output elements are dependent on which input elements.</p>
<p>However, this method is not foolproof, and it may fail to detect the correct sparsity pattern in some cases, particularly if values of <code>v</code> are used in control-flow statements.
If DiffSol does not detect the correct sparsity pattern, you can manually specify the jacobian. To do this, you need
to implement the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/op/trait.NonLinearOp.html"><code>diffsol::NonLinearOp</code></a> trait for the rhs function.
This is described in more detail in the <a href="specify/./custom_problem_structs.html">"Custom Problem Structs"</a> section, but is illustrated below.</p>

<p>Once you have defined the problem, you need to create a solver to solve the problem. The available solvers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/bdf/struct.Bdf.html"><code>diffsol::Bdf</code></a>: A Backwards Difference Formulae solver, suitable for stiff problems and singular mass matrices.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/sdirk/struct.Sdirk.html"><code>diffsol::Sdirk</code></a> A Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (SDIRK or ESDIRK) solver. You can define your own butcher tableau using <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/tableau/struct.Tableau.html"><code>Tableau</code></a> or use one of the pre-defined tableaues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these solvers has a number of generic arguments, for example the <code>Bdf</code> solver has three generic arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>M</code>: The matrix type used to define the problem.</li>
<li><code>Eqn</code>: The type of the equations struct that defines the problem.</li>
<li><code>Nls</code>: The type of the non-linear solver used to solve the implicit equations in the solver.</li>
</ul>
<p>In normal use cases, Rust can infer these from your code so you don't need to specify these explicitly. The <code>Bdf</code> solver implements the <code>Default</code> trait so can be easily created using:</p>

<p>Before you can solve the problem, you need to generate an intitial state for the solution. DiffSol uses the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/method/struct.OdeSolverState.html"><code>OdeSolverState</code></a>
struct to hold the current state of the solution, this is a struct that contains the state vector, the gradient of the state vector, the time, and the current step size.</p>
<p>You can create a new state for an ODE problem using the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/method/struct.OdeSolverState.html#method.new"><code>OdeSolverState::new</code></a> method,
which takes as arguments the problem and solver instances.
This method uses the \(y_0(p, t)\) closure to generate an intial state vector, and the \(f(y, p, t)\) closure to generate the gradient of the state vector. It will also set the time to the initial time
given by the <code>OdeSolverProblem</code> struct, and will guess a suitable step size based on the initial state vector and the gradient of the state vector. If you want to set the step size manually or have
more control over the initialisation of the state, you can use the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/method/struct.OdeSolverState.html#method.new_without_initialise"><code>OdeSolverState::new_without_initialise</code></a> method.</p>

<p>Each solver implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/method/trait.OdeSolverMethod.html"><code>OdeSolverMethod</code></a> trait, which provides a number of methods to solve the problem.
The fundamental method to solve the problem is the <code>step</code> method on the <code>OdeSolverMethod</code> trait, which steps the solution forward in time by a single step, with a step size chosen by the solver
in order to satisfy the error tolerances in the <code>problem</code> struct. The <code>step</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> that contains the new state of the solution if the step was successful, or an error if the step failed.</p>

<p>The <code>step</code> method will return an error if the solver fails to converge to the solution or if the step size becomes too small.</p>
<p>Often you will want to get the solution at a specific time \(t_o\). There are two ways to do this based on your particular needs, the most lightweight way is to step the solution forward
until you are beyond \(t_o\), and then interpolate the solution back to \(t_o\) using the <code>interpolate</code> method on the <code>OdeSolverMethod</code> trait.</p>

<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The second way is to use the <code>set_stop_time</code> method on the <code>OdeSolverMethod</code> trait to stop the solver at a specific time, this will override the internal time step so that the solver stops at the specified time.
Note that this can be less efficient if you wish to continue stepping forward after the specified time, as the solver will need to be re-initialised.
The enum returned by <code>step</code> will indicate when the solver has stopped at the specified time.
Once the solver has stopped at the specified time, you can get the current state of the solution using the <code>state</code> method on the solver, which returns an <a href="https://docs.rs/diffsol/latest/diffsol/ode_solver/method/struct.OdeSolverState.html"><code>OdeSolverState</code></a> struct.</p>

<p>The goal of this chapter is to compare the performance of the DiffSol
implementation with other similar ode solver libraries. To begin with we have
focused on comparing against the popular
<a href="https://github.com/LLNL/sundials">Sundials</a> solver suite, developed by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>
<h2 id="test-problems"><a class="header" href="#test-problems">Test Problems</a></h2>
<p>To choose the test problems we have used several of the examples provided in the Sundials library. The problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>robertson</code> : A stiff DAE system with 3 equations (2 differential and 1 algebraic). In Sundials this is part of the IDA examples
and is contained in the file <code>ida/serial/idaRoberts_dns.c</code>. In Sundials the problem is solved using the Sundials dense linear solver and <code>Sunmatrix_Dense</code>, in DiffSol we use the
dense LU linear solver, dense matrices and vectors from the <a href="https://nalgebra.org">nalgebra</a> library.</li>
<li><code>robertson_ode</code>: The same problem as <code>robertson</code> but in the form of an ODE. This problem has a variable size implemented
by duplicating the 3 original equations \(n^2\) times, where \(n\) is the size input parameter. In Sundials problem is solved using the KLU sparse linear solver and the <code>Sunmatrix_Sparse</code> matrix, and in DiffSol we use the
same KLU solver from the <a href="https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse">SuiteSparse</a> library along with the <a href="https://github.com/sarah-ek/faer-rs">faer</a> sparse matrix.
This example is part of the Sundials CVODE examples and is contained in the file <code>cvode/serial/cvRoberts_block_klu.c</code>.</li>
<li><code>heat2d</code>: A 2D heat DAE problem with boundary conditions imposed via algebraic equations. The size \(n\) input parameter sets the number of grid points along each dimension, so the
total number of equations is \(n^2\). This is part of the IDA examples and is contained in the file <code>ida/serial/idaHeat2D_klu.c</code>.
In Sundials this problem is solved using the KLU sparse linear solver and the Sunmatrix_Sparse matrix, and in DiffSol we use the same KLU solver along with the faer sparse matrix.</li>
<li><code>foodweb</code>: A predator-prey problem with diffusion on a 2D grid. The size \(n\) input parameter sets the number of grid points along each dimension and we have 2 species, so the
total number of equations is \(2n^2\) This is part of the IDA examples and is contained in the file <code>ida/serial/idaFoodWeb_bnd.c</code>.
In Sundials the problem is solved using a banded linear solver and the <code>Sunmatrix_Band</code> matrix. DiffSol does not have a banded linear solver, so we use the KLU solver for this problem along with the faer sparse matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method"><a class="header" href="#method">Method</a></h2>
<p>In each case we have taken the example files from the Sundials library at version 6.7.0, compiling and linking them against the same version of the code.
We have made minimal modifications to the files to remove all <code>printf</code> output and to change the <code>main</code> functions to named functions to allow them to be called from rust.
We have then implemented the same problem in Rust using the DiffSol library, porting the residual functions defined in the Sundials examples to DiffSol-compatible functions representing the RHS, mass matrix and jacobian multiplication functions for the problem.
We have used the outputs published in the Sundials examples as the reference outputs for the tests to ensure that the implementations are equivalent.
The relative and absolute tolerances for the solvers were set to the same values in both implementations.</p>
<p>There are a number of differences between the Sundials and DiffSol implementations that may affect the performance of the solvers. The main differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sundials IDA solver has the problem defined as a general DAE system, while the DiffSol solver has access to the RHS and mass matrix functions separately.
The Sundials CVODE solver has the problem defined as an ODE system and the mass is implicitly an identity matrix, and this is the same for the DiffSol implementation for the <code>robertson_ode</code> problem.</li>
<li>In the Sundials examples that use a user-defined jacobian (<code>robertson</code>, <code>robertson_ode</code>, <code>heat2d</code>), the jacobian is provided as a sparse or dense matrix. In DiffSol the jacobian is provided as a function that multiplies the jacobian by a vector,
so DiffSol needs to do additional work to generate a jacobian matrix from this function.</li>
<li>Generally the types of matrices and linear solver are matched between the two implementations (see details in the "Test Problems" section above). However, the <code>foodweb</code> problem is slightly different in that
it is solved in Sundials using a banded linear solver and banded matrices and the jacobian is calculated using finite differences.
In DiffSol we use the KLU sparse linear solver and sparse matrices, and the jacobian is calculated using the jacobian function provided by the user.</li>
<li>The Sundials implementations make heavy use of indexing into arrays, as does the DiffSol implementations. In Rust these indexing is bounds checked, which affects performance slightly but was not found to be a significant factor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have also implemented the <code>robertson</code>, <code>heat2d</code> and <code>foodweb</code>
problems in the DiffSl language. For the <code>heat2d</code> and <code>foodweb</code> problems we
wrote out the diffusion matrix and mass matrix from the Rust implementations and
wrote the rest of the model by hand. For the <code>robertson</code> problem we wrote the
entire model by hand.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a class="header" href="#results">Results</a></h2>
<p>These results were generated using DiffSol v0.2.1.</p>
<p>The performance of each implementation was timed and includes all setup and solve time. The exception to this is for the DiffSl implementations, where the JIT compilation for the model was not included in the timings
(since the compilation time for the C and Rust code was also not included).
We have presented the results in the following graphs, where the x-axis is the size of the problem \(n\) and the y-axis is the time taken to solve the problem relative to the time taken by the Sundials implementation
(so \(10^0\) is the same time as Sundials, \(10^1\) is 10 times slower etc.)</p>
<h3 id="bdf-solver"><a class="header" href="#bdf-solver">Bdf solver</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/benchmarks/bench_bdf.svg" alt="Bdf" /></p>
<p>The BDF solver is the same method as that used by the Sundials IDA and CVODE solvers so we expect the performance to be largely similar, and this is generally the case.
There are differences due to the implementation details for each library, and the differences in the implementations for the linear solvers and matrices as discussed above.</p>
<p>For the small, dense, stiff <code>robertson</code> problem the DiffSol implementation is very close and only slightly faster than Sundials (about 0.9).</p>
<p>For the sparse <code>heat2d</code> problem the DiffSol implementation is slower than Sundials for smaller problems (about 2) but the performance improves significantly for larger problems until it is at about 0.3.
Since this improvement for larger systems is not seen in <code>foodweb</code> or <code>robertson_ode</code> problems, it is likely due to the fact that the <code>heat2d</code> problem has a constant jacobian matrix and the DiffSol implementation has an advantage in this case.</p>
<p>For the <code>foodweb</code> problem the DiffSol implementation is quite close to IDA for all sizes.
It is again slower for small systems (about 1.5) and the performance improves for medium systems until it reaches a value of 0.7, but then performance starts to slowly decrease for larger systems until it is about 1.0</p>
<p>The DiffSol implementation of the <code>robertson_ode</code> problem is the only problem generally slower then the Sundials CVODE implementation and is about 1.5 - 1.9 the time taken by Sundials. Since the same method and linear solver is used in both cases the cause of this discrepancy is not
due to these factors, but is likely due to the differences in how the jacobian is calculated (in Sundials it is provided directly, but DiffSol is required to calculate it from the jacobian multiplication function).</p>
<h3 id="bdf--diffsl"><a class="header" href="#bdf--diffsl">Bdf + DiffSl</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/benchmarks/bench_bdf_diffsl.svg" alt="Bdf + DiffSl" /></p>
<p>The main difference between this plot and the previous for the Bdf solver is the use of the DiffSl language for the equations, rather than Rust closures.
The trends in each case are mostly the same, and the DiffSl implementation only has a small slowdown comparared with rust closures for most problems.
This difference is minimal, and can be seen most clearly for the small <code>robertson</code> problem where the DiffSl implementation is just above 1.0 times the speed of the Sundials implementation, while the rust closure implementation is about 0.9.
However, for some larger systems the DiffSl can be faster, for example the <code>foodweb</code> problem is quicker at larger sizes, which is probably due to the fact that the rust closures bound-check the array indexing, while the DiffSl implementation does not.</p>
<p>This plot demonstrates that a DiffSL implementation can be comparable in speed to a hand-written Rust or C implementation, but much more easily wrapped and used from a high-level language like Python or R, where the equations can be passed down
to the rust solver as a simple string and then JIT compiled at runtime.</p>
